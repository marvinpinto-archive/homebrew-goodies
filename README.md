## Homebrew Tap because I hate having to rebuild these things each time

#### How do I even use this?

```bash
$ brew tap marvinpinto/goodies
$ brew cask install iterm-new-window
$ brew cask install chrome-new-window
$ brew cask install chrome-incognito
```

#### What is this I don't even trust it!

Head over to [marvinpinto/osx-apps](https://github.com/marvinpinto/osx-apps) to
see how they were built - PRs welcome!
